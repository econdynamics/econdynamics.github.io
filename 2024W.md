## Winter 2024

- We will have a single presentation each week for about 50 minutes. During this time, please limit to clarification questions.
- Please do not use this sessions as a practice job talk.
- Please be respectful of other participants and make sure to be on time. Please try to be a few minutes early.
- Please send the full slide deck ahead of time by Saturday 10pm (for Monday sessions) or Sunday 10pm (for Tuesday sessions). The slides need not be perfect and should go to all participants.
- Get to the point quickly. We do not want a long-winded introduction.
