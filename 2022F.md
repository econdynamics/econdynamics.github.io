## Fall 2022

- We will have a single presentation each week for about 45 minutes. During these 45 minutes, please limit to clarification questions.
- This will be followed with a 10 to 15 informal discussion about the research and next steps. 
- We will allocate an additional 15 to 20 minutes, calling on a couple of students to report briefly on progress since their prior presentation.This time can also be used for students who have questions (e.g., how to deal with certain problems, whether to go down a certain path without getting stuck).
- Please be respectful of other participants and make sure to be on time. We plan on starting at 4pm sharp, so please try to be a few minutes early.
