## Econ Dynamics and Financial Markets (EDFM) Working Group

The Economic Dynamics and Financial Markets (EDFM) Working Group is a weekly session in which students present their work in topics primarily in macroeconomics and finance, broadly speaking. 

The group is open to PhD students and faculty.
- Faculty Organizer: [Lars Hansen](https://larspeterhansen.org/)
- Student Coordinator: Monica Barbosa
- Past Coordinators: Joanna Harris (2023-24, 2024-25), [Sangmin Oh](https://sangmino.github.io/) (2021-22, 2022-23), Yiran Fan (2020-21), [Jane Li](https://www.lijianuchicago.com/) (2019-20)

Research can be preliminary. This is not a venue primarily geared toward formal presentation practice (e.g., job market talk practice). It is more oriented towards early-stage feedback. Please leave time at the end of your talk for discussion.

### Asking Questions
During presentations, try to ask clarifying questions or make quick suggestions, rather than asking deep questions that would require a more thoughtful response or a back-and-forth discussion. 

If you want to ask "it seems like literature X is wrong about assumption A.x whereas literature Y makes a much more plausible assumption A.y -- can you comment on why you chose to go with A.x, and what would your model/estimation look like if you went with A.y?" then you should probably save it for the Q&A. It's just way too hard to answer those questions and not get derailed.
