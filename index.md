## Econ Dynamics Working Group 2021-22

The Economic Dynamics and Financial Markets Working Group is a weekly session in which students present their work in topics primarily in macroeconomics and finance, broadly speaking. 
- Research can be preliminary. 
- This is not a venue primarily geared toward formal presentation practice (e.g., job market talk practice). It is more oriented towards early-stage feedback. 
- The group is open to PhD students and faculty.
