## Econ Dynamics Working Group

The Economic Dynamics and Financial Markets Working Group is a weekly session in which students present their work in topics primarily in macroeconomics and finance, broadly speaking. 

The group is open to PhD students and faculty and is organized by Professor Lars Hansen.

Research can be preliminary. This is not a venue primarily geared toward formal presentation practice (e.g., job market talk practice). It is more oriented towards early-stage feedback. 

### Logistics
Each presenter should prepare a 45-minute presentation.
By **Sunday 5pm**, presenters should send the student organizer a short half-page document containing:
1. Goal for the presentation: Please let us know in advance elements of your presentation that the audience can focus on
2. Project abstract
3. Agenda items for the meeting (things you'd like to go over)

### Questions
During presentations, try to ask clarifying questions or make quick suggestions, rather than asking deep questions that would require a more thoughtful response or a back-and-forth discussion. 

If you want to ask "it seems like literature X is wrong about assumption A.x whereas literature Y makes a much more plausible assumption A.y -- can you comment on why you chose to go with A.x, and what would your model/estimation look like if you went with A.y?" then you should probably save it for the Q&A. It's just way too hard to answer those questions and not get derailed.
