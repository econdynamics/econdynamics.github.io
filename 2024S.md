## Spring 2024

- We will have a single presentation each week for about 50 minutes. During this time, please limit to clarification questions.
- Please do not use this sessions as a practice job talk.
- Please be respectful of other participants and make sure to be on time. Please try to be a few minutes early.
- Please send the full slide deck ahead of time by Saturday 10pm. The slides need not be perfect and should go to all participants.
- Get to the point quickly. We do not want a long-winded introduction.
